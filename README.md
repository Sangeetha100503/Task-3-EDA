# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Dataset
Iris Dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Visualized numerical features using histograms
- Analyzed categorical data using count plots
- Identified outliers using box plots
- Studied feature relationships using correlation heatmap
- Identified important features for prediction

## Key Insights
- Dataset has no missing values
- Petal length and petal width are highly correlated
- These features are important for classification tasks

## Outcome
This task helped in understanding data patterns, relationships, and feature behavior using EDA techniques.
